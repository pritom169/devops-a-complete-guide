# Introduction to Linux

When a user logs into a Linux system and opens the **Files** application, they are directed to their **home directory**. Each user has a dedicated home directory within the Linux file system. This directory is located inside the system's main **root (`/`) directory**, under the `home` folder.

Within the `/home` directory, you will find individual subdirectories corresponding to each user on the system.

The **root user** is an exception. Instead of a home directory under `/home`, the root user has a separate home directory located at `/root`.

## bin

The `bin` directory contains essential user-level executable programs and commands. These binaries are required for basic system operation and are available for all users.

## sbin

The `sbin` directory contains system administration binaries. These commands are primarily intended for performing system-level tasks and typically require superuser (root) privileges to execute.

## lib

/lib contains shared libraries that are required for the system’s fundamental programs to run — especially those in /bin and /sbin.

- Stores essential shared libraries needed during system boot.
- Required even before the /usr partition is mounted, which is why critical libraries must live here.
