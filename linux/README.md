# Introduction to Linux

When a user logs into a Linux system and opens the **Files** application, they are directed to their **home directory**. Each user has a dedicated home directory within the Linux file system. This directory is located inside the system's main **root (`/`) directory**, under the `home` folder.

Within the `/home` directory, you will find individual subdirectories corresponding to each user on the system.

The **root user** is an exception. Instead of a home directory under `/home`, the root user has a separate home directory located at `/root`.
